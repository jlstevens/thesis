This repository is a reproducible record of my PhD thesis,
including the necessary LaTeX files, SVG figures and Jupyter
notebooks needed to build the PDF document as well as reproduce
the scientific results. This repository has three branches:

**master** : Files needed to build the PDF [thesis document](https://github.com/jlstevens/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf).

**stevens_thesis16** : Supporting code that offers the ``stevens_thesis16`` Python package. Install with:

```
pip install https://github.com/jlstevens/thesis/archive/stevens_thesis16.zip
```
