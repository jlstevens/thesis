This is the index for the **Unifying developmental and evoked response
dynamics** chapter of my thesis which can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/jlstevens/thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf). 

This page acts as an index to a number of other notebooks, that taken
together reproduce all the results presented in this thesis
chapter. These notebooks requires a version of Topographica that has the
CGCAL and TCAL models available, introduced in [this
PR](https://github.com/ioam/topographica/pull/665).

[<i>CGCAL</i>](cgcal.html) : This notebook explores the CGCAL model,
visualizing PSTH profiles in the LGN, the activity response to a
shifting line stimulus as well as the orientation preference map after
20000 fixations.

[<i>GCAL</i>](gcal_vs_cgcal.html) : This notebook explores the GCAL
model in order to contrast it with the CGCAL results given in the
notebook above. Once again, PSTH profiles are visualized in the LGN, the
activity response to a shifting line stimulus is explored and the
orientation preference map after 20000 fixations is computed.
