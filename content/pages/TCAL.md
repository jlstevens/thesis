This is the index for the **Unifying developmental and evoked response
dynamics** chapter of my thesis which can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/jlstevens/thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf). 

This page acts as an index to a number of other notebooks, that taken
together reproduce all the results presented in this thesis
chapter. These notebooks requires a version of Topographica that has the
CGCAL and TCAL models available, introduced in [this
PR](https://github.com/ioam/topographica/pull/665).

[<i>CGCAL</i>](cgcal.html) : This notebook explores the CGAL model,
visualizing PSTH profiles in the LGN, the activity response to a
shifting line stimulus as well as the orientation preference map after
20000 fixations.
