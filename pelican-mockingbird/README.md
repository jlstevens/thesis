# mockingbird for pelican

This theme has been adapted from pelican mockingbird which in turn was
a port of [Nevan Scott]'s [Mockingbird] theme, originally developed
for Chyrp.

The version used corresponds to commit fa46a80 of the mockingbird
theme (cloned from https://github.com/wrl/pelican-mockingbird) with
some initial [modifications](https://github.com/jlstevens/cortical-code/wiki/Initial-changes-to-mockingbird-theme)
