The possibility offered for in vivo (and in vitro) brain imaging is unprecedented in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. However, the unresolved multi-component origin of the optical signal encourages us to perform a detailed analysis of the method limitation and the existing models. We propose a biophysical model at a mesoscopic scale in order to understand and interpret this signal.}},
